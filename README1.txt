This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, to begin the development server you must first run:

### `npm install`

This will install the node modules listed in the dependencies in package.json. You may need to run `npm install` in both the /client/ and /backend/ folders before running it in the parent directory. If any dependency issues arise, try deleting package-lock.json and running `npm install` again.

### `npm start`

Once the node modules have been installed, `npm start` can be executed to begin the development server. When this is running successfully, the user can connect to the development server by connecting to `localhost:3000` in their browser of choice (Firefox, Chrome preferred).
